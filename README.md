Sample login pages for Salesforce Communities

To get started:

1. Zip the _include directory and create a new public static resource called "include"
2. Create a user field set called "Registration" assuming you want to support signup
3. Create the Forgot/Signup/Signin Controllers from the Apex directory
4. Create the 4 visualforce pages in the Pages directory 
5. Replace your CommunitiesLandingController and CommunitiesLoginController with those provided  
6. Manage your Community, and drill into the Force.com site. Approve the signup, signin, and forgot pages for the Site so they can be viewed anonymously
7. Optionally create any Auth Providers for Social Login
8. Browse to your Community URL and see if things are working
9. Make it your own
